# **Game Overview**

This game is a dungeon adventure game where the player explores different levels of a dungeon, fights enemies, and collects items to progress. The game is text-based and offers various character classes, each with unique abilities and strengths.

# **How the Game Works**

- The player starts by choosing a character class (e.g., Shade, Vampire, Werewolf, etc.).
- The game is played on a grid where each cell can contain different elements like enemies, items, or the player.
- The objective is to navigate through the dungeon, defeat enemies, collect gold, and reach the exit.

# **Controls and Gameplay**

- Use the following keys to move your character on the grid:
  - j/no : Move Up/North
  - k/so : Move Down/South
  - l/ea : Move Right/East
  - h/we : Move Left/West
  - K/ne : Move top-right/NorthEast
  - J/nw : Move top-left/NorthWest
  - L/se : Move down-right/SouthEast
  - H/sw : Move down-left/SouthWest

- Enemy automatically attacks when the player steps into one of its surrounding cells. Player can attack the enemy using 'a' key followed by a space and the direction of the attack.
  For example: _a ne_, attacks the enemy in the cell that is top-right/NorthEast of the player.
- The combat between player and enemies depend on their races. Each character class has unique attributes that affect gameplay (e.g., health points, attack power).
  
- Potions can be picked up by the player using 'u' key followed by a space and the direction of the potion that is one cell away from the player.
  For example: _u no_, uses the potion in the cell that is top/north of the player.
- There are potions that increase the stats of the player as well as decrease them. Player will find out the effect a potion has only after he uses it.

- Treasures can be picked up by walking over them except the treasure that is being guarded by a dragon. Player has to defeat the dragon to gain the treasure.
